## lll
ll is the shortName of Love Live. In China, we call Love Live Project lovers as "llers". The Name of lll is of my mistake that directly sync my files named from my project folder, and the reason why I do not alter it is I do not like announce anything that I care and love. Only the real lovers can meet with us ~~(currently only myself and one my classmate😅)~~.
